Questions to ask when choosing a caterer -
</br>
<h3>What services are included and not included-</h3> Some caterers may not include services like cutting and serving the cake, or providing coffee service, etc that can enhance your guests’ experience.
</br>
<h3>What is the server-to-guest ratio - </h3>This will help you understand how readily food and snacks would be available to your guests, whether there will be enough servers to take care of the guests demands, how quickly the plates are being cleared, etc.
</br>
<h3>Have you catered a previous event at my venue -</h3> Having a prior experience gives an edge to the wedding food caterer, who would already have an idea of his setup and plating at the venue and how many servers would be needed, amongst other things.
</br>
<h3>Where will the food be made -</h3> Enquire if the food would be cooked at their kitchen or would they be prepping up the food at their kitchen but cooking it on-site.
